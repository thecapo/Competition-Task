## Talent Competition Code Repository

This project will help interns at MVP Studio to understand how ReactJs, C# Web Api, MongoDb is used in Talent Code Architecture. 

Please follow the instructions below to understand how to get started. If you have any questions, please check if it's asked on QuestionHub or raise the question there to get support. 

### React tutorials/resources
* https://reactjs.org/docs/hello-world.html
* MVP Studio React Training.pdf can be found here
ReactExamples.zip can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1dXZeb3hmMsYbE1hmGEkb4_hyOkNiAbPa/view?usp=sharing)

**Don't add any new fields to the Models or add new fields to the documents in the database.**  
For example,  don't add any new fields to the User or Job models.
 
### Install react, babel, webpack, js tokens and react tags:
* Find the folder that contains webpack.config.js in the solution explorer
* Right click on the folder and select 'Open Folder in File Explorer'
* Open command prompt (windows + R, type cmd) and go to the folder that contains webpack.config.js (E.g: cd C:\Talent\Talent\Talent.WebApp\Scripts\react)
Install npm util packages:
`npm install`
* Check webpack version (make sure it's 4.5.0):
`webpack -version`

### Launch Talent project
[Check the wiki](http://git.mvp.studio/talent-competition/talent-competition/wikis/guides/Starting-the-project) for more details.
* Get the latest source via Source Control Explorer
* Run webpack:
`cd C:\Talent\Talent\App\Talent.App.WebApp\wwwroot\js\react`
`npm run build`

### Project Structure  
[Check the wiki](http://git.mvp.studio/talent-competition/talent-competition/wikis/guides/project-structure) for more details.
 - Web Application:
    - `Talent.WebApp` : All frontend files are located here
 - Microservices:
    - `Talent.Services.Identity` : backend functions related to Login/Logout
    - `Talent.Services.Profile` : backend functions related to Profile
    - `Talent.Services.Talent` : backend functions related to Talent Matching, Jobs

### React tips
* Common coding mistakes using jsx
* Class names: class (html) => className (jsx), tabindex (html) => tabIndex (jsx)
* Require closing parent element or fragments: https://reactjs.org/docs/fragments.html
* Jsx Closing tags differ from html tags, you must have a closing tag for images and inputs: `<img></img>, <input</input>`
* Forgetting to turn on webpack : `npm run build`
* Forgetting to clear the cache

### How to connect to the database

**Step 1: Start MongoDB**
```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

**Step 2: Start Microservices**
```bash
dotnet run --project Talent.Services.Identity
dotnet run --project Talent.Services.Profile
dotnet run --project Talent.Services.Listing
dotnet run --project Talent.Api
```

**Note:** If you have local MongoDB running, stop it first with `killall mongod` (Mac) or `net stop MongoDB` (Windows).

## Competition task

[Click here](http://git.mvp.studio/talent-competition/talent-competition/wikis/guides/competition-task) for more details.

* Task 1 : Employer profile page
  * Add last name to the primary contact details
  * Allow users to edit company contact details by clicking on the edit button
  * Display the user's full name on primary contact details (for read only display)

  * Display jobs as a list of cards
  * Bonus/Optional: Update a job, Close a job

* Submitting tasks
  * Please submit tasks the same way you did for Onboarding:
  * Upload and zip the code, submit to the internship portal, do not need the node module
